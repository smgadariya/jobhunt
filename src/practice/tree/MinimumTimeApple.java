/*
 * Given an undirected tree consisting of n vertices numbered from 0 to n-1, which has some apples in their vertices. You spend 1 second to walk over one edge of the tree. Return the minimum time in seconds you have to spend in order to collect all apples in the tree starting at vertex 0 and coming back to this vertex.

The edges of the undirected tree are given in the array edges, where edges[i] = [fromi, toi] means that exists an edge connecting the vertices fromi and toi. Additionally, there is a boolean array hasApple, where hasApple[i] = true means that vertex i has an apple, otherwise, it does not have any apple.
 * Input: n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,6]], hasApple = [false,false,true,false,true,true,false]
Output: 8 
Explanation: The figure above represents the given tree where red vertices have an apple. One optimal path to collect all apples is shown by the green arrows.

/*
 * Given a rectangular pizza represented as a rows x cols matrix containing the following characters: 'A' (an apple) and '.' (empty cell) and given the integer k. You have to cut the pizza into k pieces using k-1 cuts. 

For each cut you choose the direction: vertical or horizontal, then you choose a cut position at the cell boundary and cut the pizza into two pieces. If you cut the pizza vertically, give the left part of the pizza to a person. If you cut the pizza horizontally, give the upper part of the pizza to a person. Give the last piece of pizza to the last person.

Return the number of ways of cutting the pizza such that each piece contains at least one apple. Since the answer can be a huge number, return this modulo 10^9 + 7.
